This is my solution to the UCSDUnfoldingMaps project, which the is learning code for the *Object Oriented Programming in Java* course found on Coursera:
https://www.coursera.org/learn/object-oriented-java

This application can display volcanic activity around the world in real time using the _Unfolding Maps_library for the map implementation and _PApplet/Processing_ libraries for the UI. 
I also adopted features from Java 8 to make the code more functional and modern.
